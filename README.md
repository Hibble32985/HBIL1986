Greetings!

I'm Yvonne Cantu from the great state of Texas.  

Initially, I did what girls were taught in high school seek secretarial and administrative jobs.  I have to admit my life went in directions that brought about many career changes.  I like to think of these as more like career adventurers and opportunities.

The most grueling, sleep depriving, sometimes dangerous but definitely never boring were the years I worked at an ABC news affiliate as a field newsreporter, weekend anchor and producer, and of course, a weather girl (who knew not a thing about meteorology). However, the news business thrives on sensationalism.  Tragedies piqued people's interest.  I left the field as I felt there was something else that was more that I was better suited for that didn't entail people's downfall.

Education knocked at my door relentlessly and I found myself being in a field that led me through the classroom to the boardroom. Despite there being times that showed the downside of education, I had the chance to work with grade school students all the way through college undergrads. I seemed to have a knack for the field but for me I learned that the daily classroom environment was not quite for me.

I feel like I needed to search for something that would be quite challenging and pique my interest. Cause me to think of solutions, perhaps look at life differently. Not necessarily outside the box but perhaps create the box. Learning to code seems to be the ticket and looks like it may the life-long challenge I've been looking for.
