Greetings!

I'm Yvonne Cantu from the great state of Texas.  

My career path began in my twenties. I spent the time doing administrative work as expected, that's what high school trained most females for, being the best secretary or assistant possible. Anticipate needs. But it seemed something was always missing.

By chance I was offered to work at a television station as a field reporter, on-air anchor, weekend producer and of course weather girl. Initially, I loved it however, the news business while offering information and facts, thrives on sensationalism. I took no joy in reporting accidents with injuries, crime and people suffering traumatic situations. It was often overlooked that in these events were fellow humans. Still something wasn't right for me.

My career path took me everywhere from construction, radio, college and private school boardrooms even courtrooms when working as a legal assistant. But none of these fulfilled a desire to do something different that required creativity and thought.

Education came knocking and I spent years in grade school and college classrooms, directing programs and working with curriculum. I was good but there was a need that none of these careers offered. My mind wasn't being challenged, stretched, truly forced not to just think outside the box but create the box. Life suddenly changed and I was at a crossroads.

A decision was needed. Be safe with the status quo working successfully in education or dare to walk a path that had always been intriguing but not necessarily for females. I was convinced of the old saying that you don't miss the shots you don't take. I decided to take my shot, learn to write code.

It's taken every bit of concentration I can muster to walk this path. But walk it I will with anticipation of where I'll be going next.
