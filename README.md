Greetings!

I'm Yvonne Cantu from the great state of Texas.  

I've lived been in other states but as they say, "You can take the girl out of Texas but you can't take the Texas out of the girl." So true.  The adventures and misadventures make up the history of my life. And a cache of stories, some I've passed along. I love hearing stories about people's lives and in Texas I grew knowing it as a way to pass along as knowledge. 

You never know what's behind those eyes, in a person's soul and where the shoes have walked, have been.  I would have loved being an anthropologist and I guess you could say learning about people and cultures is a hobby that's piqued my interest for years.

I have a story to share with you I like to call Careers, College and Collections. I find it a good way to let people in to my world.  I like telling it so much better than answering the question at job interviews or getting to know others: So, tell me about yourself. 

I was a good, obedient child and teenager so there's nothing to tell there. But, beginning to live my adult life was and still is like a map that goes to all four directions and in between. And, it will continue to as such.  

Careers, some I chose and accidently came to experience many. Like a falling leaf in the wind.  Sometimes it's path is predictable or it can go anywhere. People that come to know my life story are surprised how one person has touched so many jobs in a lifetime. Initially, I did what girls were taught in high school seek secretarial and administrative jobs. I've been a bankruptcy legal aid, worked at a bank, did construction and for a VERY short time was on a very little rodeo circuit doing - are you ready for this?  Team roping cattle.  Yep. , One that truly piqued my interest as a young adult, mostly because I kept being told I couldn't do it, was being the "header". My job was to lasso a quick as lightning cow's head.  My partner roped the back feet. It was exciting, unpredictable,  and you always had dirt in your hair, shirt and pants.  I learned that girls can sweat just as good as boys, too. There were very few women but I didn't care or think about quitting. Heck, when you're young and in your twenties you're invincible. Until I saw a girl fall off her horse. The spooked cow was out of control and trampled her head and face.  I'm not a vain person but I didn't relish the possibility of coming hoof to face with any hooved creature.

But, the most grueling, sleep depriving, sometimes dangerous but definitely never boring were the years I worked at an ABC news affiliate as a field newsreporter, weekend anchor and producer, and of course, a weather girl (who knew not a thing about meteorology).

My family loved it.  The recognition in town, being part of special events, meeting well-known and famous people and even appearing on Good Morning America in New York City a few times. Have you ever heard of country singer George Strait?  Country entertainer of the year for decades?  Nice fella.  Dubyuh, then Vice-President  George W. Bush. A few celebrities but they paled in comparison to the everyday folks.  The kid that won an award for finding and turning in to the police cash that belonged to an elderly woman who was mugged, the mom that had the first set of triplets in town, high schoolers earning scholarships or making college athletic teams, county fair winners, the medical field and, of course, the law enforcement and political beat. My favorites had to be interviewing Korean War and Vietnam veterans.They had so much to say but so few would really listen. Also, going to schools to talk to students about the importance of education, being an upstanding responsible person and to make a positive difference no matter how small.

Never a dull moment or lollygagging. I was frequently doing research, microphone in hand I ran alongside police chasing down escapees from the local jail once (and yes, I have been shot at) to get the story. Tips would be followed to do some checking up on suspicious politicians. Some days you spent trying to find a story to appease the boss.  On a slow news day it was like forcing it to rain. And, you worked holidays, in bad weather, sick and perhaps dangerous situations.  But, I decided it wasn't for me after many years.  

The news business thrives on sensationalism.  Tragedies piqued people's interest.  One Christmas a family's home caught fire.  The entire family suffered smoke inhalation and even a few burns, lost everything in the home. I happened to be in the car when the video photographer was dispatched to record the incident. Knowing I was there, the news director told me to run over to speak with the family and ask how they felt, put the mic in their face to generate even more sobs.  He thought it would be a great, exciting story the would pique people's interest and boost the ratings. I refused. He threatened do it or else I would be out of a job. Reluctantly, I trudged over near the family, got the mic plugged in and saw the mother holding her infant with black soot around it's nose and coughing, gasping for fresh air. I was not going to do it.  Tragedy was not for entertainment.  These were real people who were suffering, crying and shivering in the cold night. The "or else" happened very cleverly.  They weren't going to fire me for refusing to do the assignment, that meant unemployment benefits.  Somehow, an award winning journalist was not performing to required standards, therefore failing to do my job I had to be "let go".

Careers after that took me through many interesting yet fulfillin, and sometimes novel, jobs. But education knocked at my door relentlessly and I found myself being in a field that led me through the classroom to the boardroom. Then came college...a little later in life.

College, I loved it.  I was a communications major but had a passion for anthropology, history and working with English as a second language students from all over the world. This was a privilege. 

Young students would complain it was too hard, they weren't met and soothed with sympathy.  College had to be one of the easiest and fulfilling experiences of my life.  Where else, except maybe the military, do you have your days planned out for you, you know what's expected and you have the chance to prepare and practice for life. I was often met with groans. I loved being a teaching assistant, rarely a dull moment.  Especially hearing the excuses a student would use for not doing their homework. 

One day I checked in on a student in a computer lab that was feverishly typing out a paper on the subject unusual newspapers.  Ther had been complaints he had stayed on a computer for about five hours when the limit was one.  It was due by the start of class in less than ten minutes.  Being the TA for the Communications Department and that particular class, he handed over the completed paper.  I skimmed it over as he gathered several sheets of paper and quickly stashed them in his backpack. This piqued my interest. "Whoa, whoa, whoa," I said, "This is some paper.  What an unusual newspaper you chose to study."  The father was the editor, the mother was a part-time English teacher and one of their sons was a sports reporter.  I quizzed him about various facts and details, all of which he stumbled over. He complained that he had a few things to do before class and he needed to leave. I insisted I would walk with him and down the hall we passed the Dean's Office. I motioned for him to go in. I was familiar with this newspaper from my hometown and knew the family personally. He complained he would be late and might miss class if we took much longer. I told him yeah, he'd probably miss class. Coach would get angry if he found out.  Scholarship rules had strict attendance requirements and the coach was notorious for spot checking, especially for their star athlete.  I showed the Dean the paper. She agreed that the paper was unique and of A quality. He was thrilled, had a big grin.  She said I gave a student an A+ for this very paper a couple years ago, actually it was her. Me. I don't think I need to explain what happened for his actions. The University lost its star athlete.

I learned in elementary school and drilled it into my daughter to never to use someone else's work and pass it on as your own. Plagiarism applies to much of life and has life altering consequences that are far reaching. I'm a stickler for giving credit where it's due, even for a quote of a few words.  I also supervised the Science Deparment's computer lab for fledgling coders and informational technology students.  Who's going to know if code that everyone uses isn't yours?  These newbies had no idea that instructors could tell and some people had a signature way of doing their work that would be obvious. You'll find I'm so careful and serious about plagiarism, even in coding, especially since being a struggling novice. I'm so particular about it that you'll find in my work that I credit all my sources. Including a dear friend who has not only been to a coding bootcamp but works in the field that helped me LEARN not copy. I think my instructor would be suspicious if I turned in a project that was outstanding this soon.  It would pique his interest.

College. It was fun and I took some dear friends into my life that are like brothers and sisters with me. I sincerely thought about becoming a professor but despite my love for education I never had a hankering to be be grading papers and making lesson plans that met state and national guidelines.  My heart wasn't in it. I felt there was something else for me.

College was a privilege. I was on a scholarship and I had goals of success to graduate with honors. And proudly I did. Computer Science had piqued my interest though. The more time I spent in the lab the more I wanted to learn.  I taught my daughter to read at three years old and to use computer and internet. Who would expect a toddler on line looking up cheat codes for video games.  A fellow classmate even taught her to look at a game's properties to search for specific types of bugs.  Talk about a child who's now an adult quite proficient in technology.

Involvement with college continued. At UTSA, my experiences in computer science garnered me the request to serve on a board as its inaugural president. I was to oversee the struggles for the Family Association's difficulty bringing in funds to help sponsor Student Life improvement activities but the accounts were disorganized. I happily and proudly served for four years. I feel one of my best accomplishments was helping to develop a database for current and potential donors of various levels, their connections and employers that matched donations. I became quite proficient in database programs. It piqued my interest and I wanted to learn more. Life just didn't allow it. You'll probably laugh at this but I know nothing about Excel, much to my husband's frustration, nor am I interested. I felt there were other aspects I was missing that I wanted to learn. Something I could learn but where I could also use my organizational skills, tremendous patience, love for puzzles, and being very particular about details. Not OCD just quite determined for order at times. However, as I mentioned earlier there were also collections that I loved.

Collections, where do I start? I have several. I like to collect ballpoint pens, different kinds of paper and notepads and various kinds of offices supplies that are cutely packaged such as correction tape. So far, Korea and China lead in adorable packaging.

My husband is to blame for a few of my others. I love glass (and the sound of breaking glass, luckily my father-in-law owned a glass business and kept all the scrap glass for me...very therapeutic and stress relieving). My favorite glass artist in the world is world reknowned Dale Chihuly.  He creates intricate, awe inducing, delicate to thick scupltures. I've had the good fortune to see many of his public exhibits, special private showings and space defying chandeliers at various hotels and resorts. To own one of his pieces would be a gift I would more than treasure and definitely not let anyone touch.

This is my most well-known collections of many years, glass of all sorts of shapes and sizes - but only if it's cobalt blue. Not royal blue, bright blue or dark blue. Cobalt blue. We've moved often over the years and no one was allowed to pack the glass but me. Even the movers said I taught them a few things about safely packing fragile items. I was and still am meticulous in the task. I've never had one break.  At every house we lived in I displayed them safely above the kitchen cabinets. Each one carefully placed according to an arrangement similar at their previous home. To this day, people who see them are amazed. The story behind each one never fails to pique their interest.

It all started when we were young newlyweds and knowing how I wished to someday have a Chihuly piece of art. My husband lovingly gave me a cobalt blue bowl that sits on my table now...the only one within touching distance. But, everyone knows not to.

However, it wasn't long before friends and family began giving me "blue" pieces of glassware, they were thrilled to add to my collection. Not to be ungrateful or callous but these slowly made thier way to being donated or regifted. They weren't "cobalt blue". But, I always appreciated the time being taken to find something that was special to me. Except the cracked piece a family member gave me for a birthday that still had the garage sale sticker on it. Hmm. I accepted it with grace though.  It's the thought that counts.

Other things have piqued my interest over time as one's taste changes.  Some obvious for a woman but the start of these collections weren't my doing.

My husband traveled a great deal for work and enjoyed finding gifts he could bring home for me and our daughter.  In fact, he always left a little extra room in his carry-on for something.

I don't like gold or diamonds so he began bringing me  silver bracelets. Bracelets are my favorite piece of jewelry. I've played tennis, golf, soccer and would swim with one on. Of course, each has a safety chain (or two) and its own little container to keep it from tarnishing or developing a "patina".

Next he started bringing home brooches and pins, particularly of bugs and creepy crawly things. I have lizards, spiders, snakes and my favorites, bees. Our daughter's nickname is Bee, these are treasured. None are incredilble]y vallue except in sentiment.

A few of these collections I have to admit I, with no problem, added to. Generously. He liked finding uniques shoes that piqued his interest and purses. And really, what girl doesn't like a new purse or shoes? Particularly from Los Angeles, Miami or New York City? You don't want to know how many I have of each. But, I never throw away any of them. Some are older than my 32 year old daughter and are very well cared for. They become trendy again every few years.Many young girls admire my "vintage" footwear asking where they could buy a pair.

Naturally, every girl has that unusual pair of shoes that will probably never be worn but just had to have. They usually aren't the type of shoes you walk in. These are to go to the car, sitting and going back to the car shoes. My guilty pleasure are boots.  I realized the other day that somehow my much loved, ancient and faded with horse sweat cowboy boots were missing. I went to look for another pair - on sale, of course. I never pay full price. I found boots,pulled out my credit card and brought them home.They are beautiful and live in a special place in my closet. I probably will never wear them as I don't anticipate an occasion for them. These aren't for walking. Red rhinestone covered spike heeled boots usually aren't. But, what can I say?  They piqued my interest and were needed for my collection.

You might think "What else can this woman possibly collect next?" 

I've put my collections on hold. I have something else that has deeply piqued my interest. Something that I left my career in education for. Something that, despite being so mind boggling for me, feels like it fills that empty spot that needed something to satisfy. It had been elusive for years. Delving deeper than knowing all sorts of software, I wanted to learn to code. I've been discouraged by being told "Why would you want to do something that hard?" While I have great respect for educators, I don't have the desire to teach. The thought of being cooped up in a classroom and severely underpaid isn't appealing, so the advice of "You should get a teaching certificate!" is a big no. It doesn't make my heart anxious at how intense but unbelievably creative it is as well, it feels like the knowledge that would challenge my brain immensely, cause me to think of solutions, perhaps look at life differently. Every projects "piques" deep interest.

And, I sincerely hope to someday "pique" someone's interest with a well-done, user pleasing and client satisfied website. Actually, websiteS.

I hope you'll be interested and piqued with my labors of work that I've found intriguing, that has excited me to acquire skills that will be ever evolving and be gratifying even through the toughest challenges.

Wasn"t this better than hearing the usually stock answers to the question, "So tell me about yourself?"

If our paths ever cross say Hello!
