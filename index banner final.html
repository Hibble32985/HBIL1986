				<div><p>My career paths began in my twenties.  I spent the time doing administrative work as expected, that's what high school trained most females for. Being the best secretary or assistant possible.  Anticipate needs.  But it seemed something was always missing. 
<br><br>
By chance I was offered to work at a television station as a field reporter, on-air anchor, weekend producer and of course weather girl. Initially, I loved it however, the news business while offering information and facts, thrives on sensationalism.  I took no joy in reporting accidents with injuries, crime and people suffering traumatic situations. It was often overlooked that in these events were fellow humans.  Still something wasn't right for me.  
<br><br>
My career path took me everywhere from construction, radio, college and private school boardrooms and participating in small rodeos as a header, meaning I and a fellow cowgirl lassoed running steers. She roped the hind feet and I roped the head.  Exciting but dangerous. As a twenty-something you feel invincible.  But this still didn't fulfill a desire to do something more, that made an impact on people.
<br><br>
Education came knocking and I spent years in grade school and college classrooms, directing programs and working with curriculum.  I was good but there was a need that none of these careers offered. My mind wasn't being challenged, stretched, truly forced not to just think outside the box but create the box. Life suddenly changed and I was at a crossroads.
<br><br>
A decision was needed. Be safe with the status quo working successfully in education or dare to walk a path that had always been intriguing but not necessarily for females. I was convinced of the old saying that you don't miss the shots you don't take. I decided to take my shot, learn to write code. 
<br><br>
It's taken every bit of concentration I can muster to walk this path. But walk it I will with anticipation of where I'll be going next.</p></div>
